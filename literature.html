    <div class="something;"><h2>Poetry</h2>In my first year of secondary school I wrote some poetry, as poetry is one of my hobbies.<br>
        The two poems I wrote were:
    <ul>
        <li>Oh Creation!, </li>
        <li>MAN</li>
        <BR>
            <br>
            <BR>
    </ul>
    <h2>Oh Creation!</h2><p class="creation">
    Oh creation, with the birds and the fishes,<br>
    Oh creation, granting all my wishes;<br>
    Oh creation, with the rainbow in the sky,<br>
    When I gaze, I must say, 'Oh my'.
    </p>
    <p class="creation">Oh creation, with the rain and the sun,<br>
    Oh creation, filling me with joy and fun;<br>
    And oh, plants, with their beautiful flowers,<br>
    Beautiful enough to be thought to have powers.</p>
    <p class="creation">And wow, us humans, with our marvelous brains,<br>
        For us to know our rejoices and pains;<br>
        Can creation be more beauttiful, I wonder;<br>
        All I know is it's as beautiful as ever.
    </p>
    <h2>Man</h2><p class="shake">
    Man started well with perfection and paradise,<br>
    But deceit and fallacies overtook his selfish, naive mind;<br>
    His love for God and faith in Him was left behind.</p>
    <p class="shake">
        He went on to live in suffering and sin,<br>
        To fight a battle impossible to win;<br>
        Things for him continue to get worse every second,<br>
        All he can do now is ponder over how his life horribly turned.
    </p>
    <p class="shake">
        At the end, he will be risen up once again,<br>
        He will be freed from this prison chain;<br>
        He will enjoy happiness and joy everyday;<br>
        He will have a second chance to follow the right way.
    </p></div>
